## How I Rebuilt the Zentry Website

1. **Design Analysis:**
   - Carefully analyzed the original Zentry website’s layout, animations, and design elements to understand its structure.
   - Created wireframes and a plan to prioritize key features and animations.

   - Initialized a React project with Vite for optimal build performance.
   - Installed and configured TailwindCSS and GSAP.

3. **Recreation Process:**
   - **Layout:** Recreated the core structure using React components and styled them with TailwindCSS.
   - **Animations:**
     - Utilized GSAP’s ScrollTrigger plugin for scroll-based animations.
     - Implemented hover effects and dynamic transitions using GSAP timelines.
     - Added microinteractions using features in TailwindCSS and through GSAP.

4. **Testing and Deployment:**
   - Tested the website across multiple browsers and devices to ensure compatibility.
   - Deployed the final version on Vercel for live access.
